# GreenScreenAI-Plant-Disease-Detection-Model
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to detect and classify plant diseases using leaf images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which includes 38 disease categories and healthy leaves. The model, built with TensorFlow and Keras, achieved a validation accuracy of 92.3%,.
