# GreenScreenAI-Plant-Disease-Detection-Model
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to detect and classify plant diseases using leaf images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which includes 38 disease categories and healthy leaves. The model, built with TensorFlow and Keras, achieved a validation accuracy of 92.3%,.

This project presents a practical and effective solution for detecting plant diseases using deep
learning. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the PlantVillage dataset, the
system can accurately recognise 38 types of plant diseases, reaching a strong validation
accuracy of 92.3%. Careful steps were taken throughout, including image processing, data
augmentation, and model tuning, to make sure the system is both accurate and reliable.
Although this version focuses only on the backend, it’s fully prepared for future use in realworld applications, such as a mobile or web-based tool to support farmers and researchers.
With early and correct detection, this tool could help reduce crop damage, improve
productivity, and support better farming decisions. In future, improvements such as a userfriendly interface, wider dataset coverage, and real-time predictions could make the system
even more useful and accessible. It’s a solid step towards smarter and more sustainable
agriculture
